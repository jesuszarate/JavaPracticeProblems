 * POND SIZES: You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the value at that
 * location represents the height above sea level. A value of zero indicates water. A pond is
 * a region of water connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The size of the pond
 * is the total number of connected water cells. Write a method to compute the sizes of all
 * ponds in the matrix.
 *
 * Example
 * input:
 *  0 2 1 0
 *  0 1 0 1
 *  1 1 0 1
 *  0 1 0 1
